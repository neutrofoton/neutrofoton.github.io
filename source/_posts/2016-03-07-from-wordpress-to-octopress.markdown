I have just migrated my blog engine from <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. After exploring (googling) for hours about it, how to install, customize, hosting etc, finally I got a decision :
> Ok I will migrate my blog to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.

<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is a framework designed for Jekyll, the static blogging engine powering <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> Pages.
In this post, I will not write detail about <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. Many complete articles out there available to be as reference.

The reasons that make me interest in <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> are :
<ol>
<li>No database needed</li>
<li>Hosting does not have to have php support </li>
<li>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a></li>
<li>Having nice project structure, very intuitive to customize it. Just need html, would be better if have ruby knowledge but not have to</li>
<li>Supported by github, so can use terminal to post articles</li>
<li>Many plugin support</li>
<li>Can use any simple text editor like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> or even <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> etc</li>
</ol>

I plan will not maintain http://www.neutrofoton.com anymore. Even though at the time of this blog post the site is still accessible and maybe some articles visible on google search. In case the links are broken, please kindly find the related articles on https://neutrofoton.github.io

The last, I would say thank you very much to <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> for had been my platform writing blog, and welcome <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> for being the new one :)
